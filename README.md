# esp32-ble-custom-serial

A custom BLE service that can be used to implement a simple serial interface.

## Design

TODO: Brief description of the software.

## Requirements

An ESP32 toolchain is required to build the firmware. The project is configured
to find it located in the /opt directory (/opt/xtensa-esp32-elf), but the path
can be altered by running 'make menuconfig'.
